## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: ML section not visible
**Solution:** Train models first (ML Dashboard → Train Models)

### Issue: Chart not rendering
**Solution:** Check console, ensure Recharts installed, clear cache

### Issue: 403 Forbidden
**Solution:** Login with admin account

### Issue: API returns error
**Solution:** Check backend logs, verify MongoDB connected

**For more:** See TESTING_GUIDE.md → Troubleshooting section
