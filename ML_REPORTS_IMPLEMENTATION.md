# ML-Driven Reports Integration - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the integration of Machine Learning models into the MediTrack Admin Reports section. The implementation allows admins to view model performance comparison, detailed metrics, and ML-driven predictions all within the Reports dashboard.

## Architecture

### Backend (Node.js + Express)

#### New Route: `/api/reports/ml-analysis`
**Location:** `server/routes/reports.js`

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/reports/ml-analysis`
- **Authentication:** Required (Admin only)
- **Purpose:** Fetch ML model analysis and performance metrics
- **Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "knn",
      "accuracy": 88.5,
      "precision": 85.2,

  }
}
```

### Machine Learning Models

The system includes 5 pre-trained ML models implemented in pure JavaScript:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - File: `server/ml/models.js`
   - Uses Euclidean distance to find k nearest neighbors
   - Parameter: k=5 (number of neighbors)
   - Best for: Local pattern detection

2. **Decision Tree**
   - File: `server/ml/models.js`
   - Rule-based classification using threshold analysis
   - Uses z-score for feature normalization
   - Best for: Interpretable decision rules

3. **Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)**
   - File: `server/ml/models.js`
   - Probabilistic model using Bayes' theorem
   - Assumes Gaussian (normal) distribution
   - Best for: Fast probabilistic predictions

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - File: `server/ml/models.js`
   - Linear classifier with gradient descent training
   - Uses sigmoid activation for probability
   - Best for: Binary classification

5. **Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN)**
   - File: `server/ml/models.js`
   - Simple 2-layer neural network
   - Hidden units: 10
   - Uses backpropagation for training
   - Best for: Complex non-linear patterns

### Service Layer

**File:** `server/ml/labAnomalyDetection.js`

The `LabAnomalyDetectionService` manages:
- Model initialization
- Data preparation and normalization
- Training coordination
- Metric calculation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Ensemble predictions
- Model comparison

### Frontend (React + Material-UI)

#### Updated Component: `Reports.jsx`
**Location:** `meditrack-client/src/pages/admin/Reports.jsx`

**New State Variables:**
- `mlData`: Stores ML analysis results
- `mlLoading`: Loading state for ML data fetch

**New useEffect:**
- Fetches ML analysis data on component mount
- Handles errors gracefully (non-blocking)

**New UI Sections:**

1. **ML Model Intelligence Card** (Gradient Background)
   - Shows training status
   - Displays prediction summary
   - Last training date
   - Model reliability level

2. **Model Performance Comparison Chart**
   - Bar chart using Recharts
   - Compares all models side-by-side
   - Shows Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Interactive tooltips

3. **Detailed Model Metrics Table**
   - Comprehensive metrics for each model
   - Shows confusion matrix values (TP, FP, TN, FN)
   - Color-coded F1-Score chips:
     - Green: > 85%
     - Yellow: 70-85%
     - Red: < 70%

4. **Average Metrics Summary Cards**
   - Visual gradient cards
   - Shows average Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Quick performance overview

5. **Metrics Explanation Section**
   - Educational component
   - Explains what each metric means
   - Helps admins understand model performance

## Data Flow

### Training Models

```
1. Admin Dashboard → Train Models (button in MLDashboard.jsx)
   ↓
2. POST /api/ml/train
   ↓
3. Backend fetches historical consultation data
   ↓
4. Models are trained on 80% of data
   ↓
5. Metrics calculated on 20% test data
   ↓
6. Models saved in memory (labAnomalyDetection service)
   ↓
7. Response returned with training status
```

### Fetching ML Analysis

```
1. Reports Page Load
   ↓
2. GET /api/reports/ml-analysis
   ↓
3. Backend retrieves metrics from trained models
   ↓
4. Calculates insights (best model, averages, reliability)
   ↓
5. Response sent to frontend
   ↓
6. React renders charts, tables, and summary cards
```

## Metrics Explained

### Accuracy
- **Formula:** (TP + TN) / (Total)
- **What it means:** Percentage of correct predictions overall
- **When to use:** Good general metric, but can be misleading with imbalanced data

### Precision
- **Formula:** TP / (TP + FP)
- **What it means:** Of predicted positives, how many were actually correct
- **When to use:** Important when false positives are costly

### Recall (Sensitivity)
- **Formula:** TP / (TP + FN)
- **What it means:** Of actual positives, how many were correctly identified
- **When to use:** Important when false negatives are costly

### F1-Score
- **Formula:** 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- **What it means:** Harmonic mean balancing precision and recall
- **When to use:** Best overall metric for imbalanced classification

### Confusion Matrix
- **TP (True Positives):** Correctly predicted anomalies
- **FP (False Positives):** Normal cases incorrectly marked as anomalies
- **TN (True Negatives):** Correctly identified normal cases
- **FN (False Negatives):** Anomalies missed by the model

## Model Reliability Levels

Based on best model's F1-Score:
- **Low**: F1-Score < 60% → Model performance is poor
- **Medium**: F1-Score 60-75% → Model needs improvement
- **High**: F1-Score > 75% → Model is reliable

## Integration Points

### Backend Integration
1. **Auth Middleware:** Uses `requireStaff(["Admin"])` for access control
2. **Database Models:** Uses existing Consultation model for training data
3. **Error Handling:** Consistent error response format

### Frontend Integration
1. **API Client:** Uses existing axios instance configured in `src/api/client.js`
2. **Material-UI:** Uses existing MUI components (Table, Grid, Paper, Typography, Chip)
3. **Recharts:** Uses existing charting library for visualization
4. **State Management:** Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect)

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins

1. **Train Models:**
   - Navigate to ML Dashboard
   - Click "Train Models" button
   - Models train on historical lab data
   - Status updates when complete

2. **View ML Analysis in Reports:**
   - Go to Admin Reports
   - Scroll to bottom to see ML Analysis section
   - View model comparison chart
   - Check detailed metrics table
   - Review prediction summary

3. **Interpret Results:**
   - Look at F1-Score as primary metric
   - Compare models to find best performer
   - Check average metrics for overall performance
   - Use metrics explanations if unsure about meanings

### For Developers

1. **Add New Model:**
   - Create new model class in `server/ml/models.js`
   - Implement `train()` and `predict()` methods
   - Add to `labAnomalyDetection.js` models object
   - Model automatically appears in reports

2. **Modify Metrics Calculation:**
   - Edit `calculateMetrics()` in `labAnomalyDetection.js`
   - Update response format in `/api/reports/ml-analysis`
   - Update frontend table columns if needed

3. **Customize UI:**
   - Colors in gradient cards can be changed
   - Chart data formatting in Reports.jsx
   - Metrics explanation text in explanation section
   - Add more cards or charts as needed

## Performance Considerations

- **Model Training:** Happens on-demand, not scheduled
- **Data Loaded:** Only trained models' metrics (no data re-fetching)
- **Caching:** Metrics stored in memory (cleared on server restart)
- **Frontend:** Charts render efficiently with Recharts
- **Database:** No additional database queries beyond existing consultation data

## Troubleshooting

### Models show 0% metrics
- **Cause:** Models have not been trained yet
- **Solution:** Go to ML Dashboard and click "Train Models"

### No data appears in ML section
- **Cause:** May not have sufficient training data or API error
- **Solution:** Check browser console for errors, ensure sufficient lab test data exists

### Chart not displaying
- **Cause:** Recharts library issue or data format mismatch
- **Solution:** Check browser console, verify data structure matches expected format

### API returns 403 Forbidden
- **Cause:** User is not an Admin
- **Solution:** Use admin account to access reports

## Files Modified/Created
