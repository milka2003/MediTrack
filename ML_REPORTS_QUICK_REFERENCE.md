## 🎯 Reliability Levels

Based on best model's F1-Score:

| F1-Score | Reliability | Risk |
|----------|-------------|------|
| > 75% | High | ✅ Low - Use for predictions |
| 60-75% | Medium | ⚡ Medium - Caution needed |
| < 60% | Low | ⚠️ High - Needs improvement |

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Training Models
- Need at least 10 lab test results to train
- More data = better model performance
- Can retrain anytime from ML Dashboard

### Interpreting Results
- **Look at F1-Score first** - Best overall metric
- **Compare models** - See which is best performer
- **Check Precision vs Recall** - Different trade-offs
- **Review averages** - Overall system performance

### Optimization
- Train monthly with new data
- Monitor F1-Score trends
- Retrain if performance drops
- Use best model for predictions
