pm2 start server/server.js --name "meditrack-server"
```

### Option 2: Docker
```bash
docker build -t meditrack .

```

### Option 3: Cloud Platform
- AWS/Azure/Heroku deployment
- Use appropriate Node.js runtime
- Ensure MongoDB URI configured
- Set environment variables

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: ML section not visible
**Solution:** Train models first in ML Dashboard

### Issue: Chart not rendering
**Solution:** Ensure Recharts is installed: `npm install recharts`

### Issue: 403 Forbidden error
**Solution:** Login with admin account, not regular user

### Issue: All metrics showing 0%
**Solution:** Need lab test data; create tests first, then train models

### Issue: API returns 500 error
**Solution:** Check backend logs for details, verify MongoDB connected
