# Razorpay Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### Backend Updates

**1. Bill Model (`server/models/Bill.js`)**
- Added `razorpayOrderId` field - stores Razorpay order reference
- Added `razorpayPaymentId` field - stores Razorpay payment reference
- Added `razorpaySignature` field - stores HMAC signature for verification
- Added `paymentSource` field - tracks payment method (upi, card, netbanking, cash)
- Expanded paymentMethod enum to include: Cash, Card, UPI, Netbanking, Online

**2. Billing Routes (`server/routes/billing.js`)**
- **POST /api/billing/create-order**
  - Creates Razorpay order with bill details
  - Sends amount in paise (smallest unit)
  - Stores razorpayOrderId in database
  - Returns orderId, amount, currency, and API key to frontend
  
- **POST /api/billing/verify-payment**
  - Verifies payment using HMAC SHA256 signature
  - Compares signature: `crypto.createHmac('sha256', key_secret).update(order_id|payment_id).digest('hex')`
  - Only updates bill if signature is valid
  - Sets bill status to "Paid"
  - Records payment method and payment ID
  - Returns updated bill object

**3. Server Dependencies (`server/package.json`)**
- Added `razorpay` (^3.2.2) package

### Frontend Updates

**1. New Component (`meditrack-client/src/components/RazorpayCheckout.jsx`)**
- Material-UI Dialog component for payment
- Loads Razorpay script dynamically
- Displays payment method options (UPI, Card, Netbanking)
- Shows bill summary with amount and patient details
- Handles payment flow:
  1. Creates order via backend API
  2. Opens Razorpay checkout
  3. User selects payment method and completes payment
  4. Verifies payment on backend
  5. Updates bill to "Paid" status
  6. Shows confirmation message
- Full error handling with user-friendly messages

**2. Patient Bills Page (`meditrack-client/src/pages/patient/Bills.jsx`)**
- Added imports: `RazorpayCheckout`, `PaymentIcon`, `Stack`
- Added state: `paymentDialogOpen`, `paymentSuccess`
- Added functions:
  - `handlePaymentClick()` - opens payment dialog
  - `handlePaymentSuccess()` - handles successful payment
  - `handleClosePaymentDialog()` - closes dialog
  - `getBalanceDue()` - calculates amount due
- Added "Pay Now" button in bill details dialog
- Shows success alert after payment
- Only shows Pay Now button if balance due > 0
- Integrated RazorpayCheckout component

**3. Billing Dashboard (`meditrack-client/src/pages/BillingDashboard.jsx`)**
- Added imports: `RazorpayCheckout`
- Added state: `paymentDialogOpen`
- Added "Pay Now" button in bill dialog
- Shows balance due in button
- Integrated RazorpayCheckout component
- Refreshes bills list after successful payment
- Shows success notification

### Razorpay Configuration

✅ Already configured in `.env`:
- `key_id=rzp_test_RGXWGOBliVCIpU`
- `key_secret=9Q49llzcN0kLD3021OoSstOp`

✅ Payment methods enabled:
- UPI (true) - Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM
- Card (true) - Credit & Debit cards
- Netbanking (true) - All major banks

## Security Implementation

1. **HMAC SHA256 Signature Verification**
   - Every payment is verified using secret key
   - Prevents tampering with payment data
   - Only backend knows the secret key

2. **Backend-Only Verification**
   - All sensitive operations happen on backend
   - Secret key never exposed to frontend
   - Bill status only updated after verification

3. **Bill Update Protection**
   - Payment info stored only after signature verification
   - Razorpay OrderID and PaymentID stored for reference
   - Payment source tracked for audit
