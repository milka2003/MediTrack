                      METRICS EXPLAINED
================================================================================

ACCURACY (%)
- What: Percentage of correct predictions overall
- Formula: (TP + TN) / Total
- Range: 0-100%
- When to use: General performance overview
- Example: 88% = 88 out of 100 predictions correct

PRECISION (%)
- What: Of predicted positives, how many were actually correct
- Formula: TP / (TP + FP)
- Range: 0-100%
- When to use: When false positives are costly
- Example: 85% = 85 out of 100 positive predictions were right

RECALL (%)
- What: Of actual positives, how many were correctly identified
- Formula: TP / (TP + FN)
- Range: 0-100%
- When to use: When false negatives are costly
- Example: 84% = found 84 out of 100 actual positives

F1-SCORE (%)
- What: Balanced metric combining precision and recall
- Formula: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- Range: 0-100%
- When to use: Best overall metric for imbalanced data
- Example: 84.6% = Good balance between precision and recall

CONFUSION MATRIX:
- TP (True Positives): Correctly predicted positives
- FP (False Positives): Incorrectly predicted positives
- TN (True Negatives): Correctly predicted negatives
- FN (False Negatives): Incorrectly predicted negatives
