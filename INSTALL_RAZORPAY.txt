RAZORPAY PAYMENT GATEWAY INTEGRATION - INSTALLATION GUIDE
================================================================================

STEP 1: INSTALL SERVER DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

1. Open Terminal/PowerShell
2. Navigate to server directory:
   
   cd c:\Users\MILKA JAMES\milka_hospital\meditrack\meditrack\server

3. Install npm packages:
   
   npm install

   This will install the razorpay package along with other dependencies.

4. Verify installation by checking node_modules:
   
   If "node_modules/razorpay" folder exists, installation successful.


STEP 2: VERIFY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
================================================================================

The .env file already contains Razorpay test credentials:

   key_id=rzp_test_RGXWGOBliVCIpU
   key_secret=9Q49llzcN0kLD3021OoSstOp

These are test mode credentials. For production, replace with live keys.


STEP 3: START APPLICATION
================================================================================

Terminal 1 - Start Backend:
   cd c:\Users\MILKA JAMES\milka_hospital\meditrack\meditrack\server
   npm run start
   
   Expected output:
   Connected to MongoDB
   Server running on port 5000

Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:
   cd c:\Users\MILKA JAMES\milka_hospital\meditrack\meditrack\meditrack-client
   npm start
   
   Expected output:
   Compiled successfully!
   You can now view meditrack in the browser.


STEP 4: TEST THE INTEGRATION
================================================================================

A) Test Patient Payment:
   1. Login as patient
   2. Go to Bills & Payments
   3. Click View Details on any unpaid bill
   4. Click "Pay Now" button
   5. Select payment method (UPI, Card, or Netbanking)
   6. Complete test payment

B) Test Billing Staff Payment:
   1. Login as billing staff
   2. Go to Billing Dashboard
   3. Search patient by OP number
   4. Select a visit
   5. Click "Pay Now" button
   6. Complete test payment


STEP 5: VERIFY SUCCESS
================================================================================

After successful payment, verify:

1. In UI:
   - Bill status changes to "Paid"
   - "Pay Now" button disappears
   - Success confirmation shows

2. In Database:
   - Bill document has razorpayOrderId
   - Bill document has razorpayPaymentId
   - Bill status is "Paid"

3. In Logs:
   - No errors in server console
   - No errors in browser console


TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Issue: "npm install" fails
Solution: 
   - Delete node_modules folder
   - Delete package-lock.json
   - Run "npm install" again
   - Check internet connection

Issue: Payment dialog doesn't open
Solution:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify razorpay CDN is accessible (internet connection)
   - Clear browser cache and try again

Issue: "Razorpay not loaded"
Solution:
   - Ensure internet connection is active
   - Check firewall not blocking checkout.razorpay.com
   - Try in incognito/private mode

Issue: Payment verifies but bill not updating
Solution:
   - Check server logs for "Error verifying payment"
   - Verify .env file has key_secret
   - Check database connection
   - Restart server

Issue: Invalid Signature error
Solution:
   - This is security working correctly - signature is invalid
   - Verify key_secret in .env matches Razorpay account
   - Don't modify payment data in browser
