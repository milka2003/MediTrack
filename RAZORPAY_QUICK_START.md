## 📱 Test UPI App Simulation

MediTrack now integrates with Razorpay's sandbox environment.

**For testing, use:**
- UPI ID: `success@razorpay`
- Phone: `9999999999`  
- OTP: `000000`

This simulates a successful UPI payment without real money.

## ⚙️ Payment Endpoints

Your backend now has these endpoints:

### 1. Create Payment Order
```
POST /api/billing/create-order
```

### 2. Verify Payment
```
POST /api/billing/verify-payment
```

### 3. Get Public Key
```
GET /api/billing/razorpay-key
```

All endpoints require authentication (Bearer token + Billing/Admin role).
