---

## 📋 Files Modified

### 1. Backend: `server/routes/reports.js`

**Location:** Lines 515-586

**Verification Steps:**
1. Open `server/routes/reports.js`
2. Scroll to the end of the file
3. Look for the comment: `// GET /api/reports/ml-analysis`
4. Verify you see:
   ```javascript
   router.get(
     "/ml-analysis",
     authAny,
     requireStaff(["Admin"]),
     async (req, res) => {
       // ... implementation ...
     }
   );
   ```

**Check List:**
- [ ] Route created with correct path `/ml-analysis`
- [ ] Using `authAny` middleware
- [ ] Using `requireStaff(["Admin"])` middleware
- [ ] Async handler function
- [ ] Returns JSON with `success`, `models`, and `insights`

### 2. Frontend: `meditrack-client/src/pages/admin/Reports.jsx`

**Location:** Multiple sections

**Verification Steps:**

#### A. State Variables (Around Line 79-80)
```javascript
const [mlData, setMlData] = useState(null);
const [mlLoading, setMlLoading] = useState(false);
```
- [ ] mlData state exists
- [ ] mlLoading state exists

#### B. useEffect Hook (Around Line 168-184)

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchMLAnalysis = async () => {
    // ...
    const { data } = await api.get("/reports/ml-analysis");
    // ...
  };
  fetchMLAnalysis();
}, []);
```
- [ ] useEffect exists

    </TableRow>
  </TableHead>
</Table>
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot GET /api/reports/ml-analysis"
**Cause:** Route not registered or server not restarted
**Solution:**
1. Stop server
2. Verify route exists in reports.js
3. Restart server
4. Check server logs

### Issue: "403 Forbidden"
**Cause:** User is not admin
**Solution:**
1. Logout
2. Login with admin account
3. Retry

### Issue: ML section not visible
**Cause:** mlData is null or fetch failed
**Solution:**
1. Open browser DevTools Console
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Look for network request to /reports/ml-analysis
4. Verify it returns 200 status
5. Check response data format

### Issue: Chart not rendering
**Cause:** Recharts library issue or data format
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify mlData.models is array
3. Verify models have required properties
4. Clear browser cache
5. Restart frontend

### Issue: Metrics show 0%
**Cause:** Models not trained yet
**Solution:**
1. Go to ML Dashboard
2. Click "Train Models"
3. Wait for completion
4. Return to Reports
5. Refresh page

### Issue: Confusion matrix shows 0 for all values
**Cause:** Insufficient training data
**Solution:**
1. Ensure you have lab test results in database
2. Each test should have parameterResults
3. Train models with more data
4. Try again
