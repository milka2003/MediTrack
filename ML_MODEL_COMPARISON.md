## 🎓 Algorithm Details

### KNN Algorithm Step-by-Step
```
1. Store all training data (values, abnormality flags)
2. For new test data:
   a. Calculate distance to all stored points
   b. Sort by distance, take k closest neighbors
   c. Count votes for abnormal/normal
   d. Return prediction: abnormal if majority vote yes
```

**Distance Formula:**
```
distance = sqrt((v1-t1)² + (v2-t2)² + ... + (vn-tn)²)
```

### Decision Tree Algorithm Step-by-Step
```
1. Calculate mean and std dev for each feature
2. For new test data:
   a. Calculate z-score: z = (value - mean) / std_dev
   b. If any z-score > 2.0: mark abnormal
   c. If 30%+ of features abnormal: predict abnormal
```

### Bayesian Algorithm Step-by-Step
```
1. Calculate P(Normal) and P(Abnormal) from training data
2. For each feature, calculate mean/variance for both classes
3. For new data:
   a. Calculate P(data|Normal) using Gaussian function
   b. Calculate P(data|Abnormal) using Gaussian function
   c. Return P(Abnormal|data) using Bayes' theorem
```

**Bayes Formula:**
```
P(Abnormal|data) = P(data|Abnormal) × P(Abnormal) / P(data)
```

### SVM Algorithm Step-by-Step
```
1. Initialize random weights
2. For each training sample:
   a. Calculate output: y = w·x + b
   b. If predicted wrong (y*label < 1):
      - Update weights: w = w + lr*y*x
      - Update bias: b = b + lr*y
3. Repeat multiple iterations
4. For prediction: return sigmoid(w·x + b)
```

### Neural Network Algorithm Step-by-Step
```
1. Initialize random weights for input→hidden and hidden→output
2. For each training sample:
   a. Forward pass: Calculate hidden layer activations
   b. Forward pass: Calculate output activation
   c. Calculate error
   d. Backward pass: Calculate gradients
   e. Update weights and biases
3. Repeat iterations
4. For prediction: Forward pass only
```

## 📈 When Models Perform Well/Poorly

### KNN
**Best**: Patient data with obvious clusters of normal/abnormal  
**Worst**: Noisy data or when nearest neighbors are misleading

### Decision Tree
**Best**: Data with clear threshold boundaries  
**Worst**: Complex non-linear patterns

### Bayesian
**Best**: Normally distributed data, small to medium datasets  
**Worst**: Data violating independence assumption

### SVM
**Best**: Well-separated classes  
**Worst**: Overlapping or non-linearly separable data

### Neural Network
**Best**: Large datasets, complex non-linear patterns  
**Worst**: Small datasets (overfitting), when interpretability is critical

## 🎓 Real-World Lab Example

### Scenario: Hemoglobin Testing
```
Training Data:
- 30 normal results: values 12-14 g/dL
- 20 abnormal results: values 8-10 or 15-17 g/dL

New Test: Hemoglobin = 11.5 g/dL
```

#### Predictions:
**KNN** (k=5):
- Finds 5 nearest neighbors
- 4 are normal, 1 is abnormal
- Predicts: Normal (80% confidence)

**Decision Tree**:
- z-score = (11.5 - mean) / std_dev ≈ -1.8
- Not beyond ±2.0 threshold
- Predicts: Normal

**Bayesian**:
- P(11.5|Normal) > P(11.5|Abnormal)
- Calculates posterior: P(Abnormal|11.5) ≈ 20%
- Predicts: Normal with 20% abnormal probability

**SVM**:
- Learned boundary at ~11.0
- 11.5 > 11.0
- Predicts: Normal (70% confidence via sigmoid)

**Neural Network**:
- Complex learned pattern
- Predicts: Normal (75% confidence)

**Ensemble Result**:
- 5/5 models agree: Normal ✅
- High confidence: 73% average

## 📊 Metrics Explained with Example

### Scenario: Lab Test Anomaly Detection
```
Test 100 samples where we know the truth:

Results:
- True Positives (TP) = 35    (correctly identified abnormal)
- False Positives (FP) = 5    (incorrectly flagged normal as abnormal)
- True Negatives (TN) = 55    (correctly identified normal)
- False Negatives (FN) = 5    (missed abnormal cases)
```

### Calculations:
```
Accuracy = (35 + 55) / 100 = 90%
Precision = 35 / (35 + 5) = 87.5%
Recall = 35 / (35 + 5) = 87.5%
F1 = 2 × (0.875 × 0.875) / (0.875 + 0.875) = 87.5%
```

### Interpretation:
- **Accuracy 90%**: We're right 90% of the time overall
- **Precision 87.5%**: When we say abnormal, we're correct 87.5% of time
- **Recall 87.5%**: We catch 87.5% of actual abnormal cases
- **F1 87.5%**: Balanced performance - good!

## 🚀 Recommendations

### For Hospital Lab Use:
1. **Primary**: Use **Ensemble voting** (all 5 together)
2. **Fallback**: If ensemble disagrees, use **Neural Network** (highest accuracy)
3. **Explanation**: Use **Decision Tree** rules to explain to staff

### Best Practice:
```javascript
// Use ensemble by default
if (ensemble.votesForAnomalous > 2 out of 5) {
  FLAG AS ANOMALOUS
}

// Show confidence from all models
// Let technician make final decision with AI assistance
```

### Training Strategy:
1. Start with 50 historical results
2. Train models
3. Check metrics
4. Retrain with 100+ results when available
5. Continue retraining monthly
